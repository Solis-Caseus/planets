Hark! All ye who gaze upon my visage!
Bow before the ancient might of Ares!
The rivers run red upon me, the earth
itself soaked with the lives of those
defiant. Tremble in fear, be ye brave
or be ye cowardly. In my path follows
Death, in my wake only ashes remain.
Hark! All ye who gaze upon my visage!
